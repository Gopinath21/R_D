Steamling the FOXTEL data setup:

1) Fetch the FOXTEL exchanage:
1) I have below exchanges which are cable of FOXTEL.

2) FOXTEL vacant data :
1) We can ask NPAMS team to provide vacant data under the above exchanbe along with SQ results ( FOXTEL over cable / FOXTEL over satellite )

3) Validation the FOXTEL data:
1) we can validate all tag IDs at EAI team end.( We can get good to use tag IDs from EAI team).


Achivements:-

1)  We no need to request FOXTEL team to provide the data.
2)  We can save mininum 2 to 3 bussiness days for every data setup. (Some times more than week).
3)  We no need to validate the FOXTEL data again with NPAMS as considering the correct process.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Efforts:

1) Efforts are done from setup.
2) This step already I immplemented for FOSS IR.
3) Setup 3 we can check .


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Is their anything more :
-----------------------

1)We can reuse the same foxtel tag id by chainging the FOXTEL FNN.( yes it is crazy ideal but , I can do it ) .
